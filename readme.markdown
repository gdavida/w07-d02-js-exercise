# Week 7, Day 2 - JS Practice
http://gdavida.github.io/w07-d01-js-exercises/index.html

## Description

You'll fulfill the specifications below (given the provided HTML, CSS, and JS)
and deploy this project to GitHub pages.

## Specifications

1. Each element, when clicked, should do exactly like it says.
2. Instead of applying or removing styles inline, you should apply or remove
   classes. You may wish to define additional classes.
3. Your project should be deployed to GitHub pages


## Bonus Goals

1. Apply additional styling (esp. with a framework such as Bootstrap or
   Materialize).
2. Some links have paired functions, e.g. "Make all headers green" v. "Return
   all headers to being not-green" -- if there are things like this, have one
   member of a given pair (e.g. "Green" v. "Not Green") be shown or hidden
   depending on which action is available to a user.
3. Our mouse cursor changes shape and type depending on what it's hovering over.
   The "hand" icon is conventionally the one we use to indicate that something
   is clickable. Make sure that our cursor appropriately reflects the
   clickability of the item it's hovering over.
4. In the past (yesterday), we used `prompt` and `alert` to get and show
   information to the user. Learn how to create *modal* boxes which perform the
   same function, but can be styled. If you want to go further, see what you can
   do to get information from a form into some Javascript. We'll cover this
   tomorrow.
